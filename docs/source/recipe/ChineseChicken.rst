Oven Instructions
#################

Line baking tray with foil then greaseproof paper.
Shake excess marinade off wings (but reserve the marinade) and spread on baking tray – can be fairly snug but not super squished (use 2 trays if needed).
Bake 45 – 50 minutes, basting with a brush at 25 minutes and 35 minutes, using the reserved marinade and juieces on the tray.
The meat should be able to be pulled off the bones quite easily, they should be just starting to char on the edges and a sticky, dark red/golden colour all over.
Sprinkle with garnishes – coriander/cilantro leaves, sesame seeds, chilli, sliced shallots/scallions – then serve!
