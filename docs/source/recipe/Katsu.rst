Instructions

1. Rinse the sushi rice until the water runs clear, then soak in cold water for 30 minutes. Drain.
2. To make the sauce, heat the oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the carrots, onion, garlic, and ginger and cook until softened.
3. Stir in the curry powder and cayenne pepper and cook for 1 minute.
4. Add the coconut milk, chicken stock, soy sauce, honey, and malt vinegar. Bring to a simmer and cook for 20–25 minutes until the vegetables are very soft and the sauce has reduced slightly.
5. Blend the sauce until smooth using a stick blender or liquidiser. Keep warm.
6. Place the soaked rice in a saucepan with 500 ml water and salt. Bring to a boil, reduce to a gentle simmer, cover, and cook for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and leave to steam, covered, for 10 minutes.
7. Place each chicken breast between sheets of cling film and pound to about 3–4 mm thickness. Season with salt and black pepper.
8. Set up three shallow dishes with the flour, beaten egg, and panko breadcrumbs. Coat each chicken breast in flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs.
9. Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Fry the chicken for 4–5 minutes on each side until golden brown and cooked through. Cook in batches if necessary.
10. Slice the chicken diagonally and serve with the rice. Spoon over the curry sauce.
