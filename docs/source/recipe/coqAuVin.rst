Ingredients

- 6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
- 6 bone-in, skin-on chicken drumsticks
- Salt
- Black pepper
- 170 g bacon, diced
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 carrots, sliced
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 30 g tomato paste
- 2 tbsp plain flour
- 480 ml dry red wine (such as Burgundy or Pinot Noir)
- 240 ml chicken stock
- 2 bay leaves
- 4 sprigs fresh thyme
- 225 g mushrooms, sliced
- 30 g butter
- Fresh parsley, chopped

Instructions

1. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels and season generously with salt and black pepper.
2. In a large Dutch oven over medium heat, cook the diced bacon until crispy. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside, leaving the fat in the pot.
3. Add olive oil to the pot if needed. Brown the chicken pieces on all sides, working in batches to avoid overcrowding. Remove and set aside.
4. Add the onion and carrots to the pot and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant.
5. Add the tomato paste and cook for 1 minute. Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir well to coat.
6. Pour in the red wine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Add the chicken stock, bay leaves, and thyme. Return the chicken and bacon to the pot.
7. Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook on low heat for about 1 hour, or until the chicken is tender.
8. While the chicken cooks, sauté the mushrooms in butter in a frying pan over medium heat until golden. Season with salt and black pepper.
9. Once the chicken is done, discard the bay leaves and thyme sprigs. Stir in the sautéed mushrooms.
10. Adjust seasoning if needed and garnish with chopped parsley before serving.
